# TRANSMUT-Spark and Scalamu Comparison Experiments

Projects with the comparison experiments of TRANSMUT-Spark and Scalamu mutation testing tools. 

Projects:

* `transmut-spark-experiments`: project with the tests that were designed to kill the mutants generated by TRANSMUT-Spark. The mutation testing reports were also generated by TRANSMUT-Spark;
* `scalamu-experiments`: project with the tests that were designed to kill the mutants generated by Scalamu. The mutation testing reports were also generated by Scalamu;
* `transmut-spark-experiments-with-scalamu-tests`: project with the tests that were designed to kill the mutants generated by Scalamu, but with the mutation testing reports generated by TRANSMUT-Spark. In this project, we evaluate whether the tests designed to kill the mutants generated by Scalamu can kill the mutants generated by TRANSMUT-Spark;
